I'm currently a Phd candidate at [University of Sydney](https://www.sydney.edu.au/engineering/about/our-people/research-students/rein-liu-210.html) in Electrical and Information Engineering. My Phd thesis is 'Interpretable and Controllable Sound Effects Generation with Neural Audio Synthesis' targeted at sound design applications. Specifically, I proposed several methods by taking advantage of pre-trained large audio representation models (CLAP, PANNs, VGGish, etc) to distill information from limited audio datasets and used such information to guide and control the audio synthesis. I typically work with generative models (Diffusion, Transformer, RAVE, StyleGAN) and differentiable digital signal processing (DDSP). 

I come from a highly diverse background. Prior to my Phd, I received my B.A. Music and Sound Design at University of Technology Sydney and M.A. Interaction Design and Electronic Arts at University of Sydney. You can access my [portfolio](https://vimeo.com/reinliu) prior to 2021, when I was a media artist and sound designer. In 2023, I was a research intern at [Dolby Laboratories](https://www.dolby.com/) Advanced Technology Group(ATG) working on DDSP for general audio synthesis and control.

Outside from work, I play and teach the first electronic instrument called the Theremin. You can find my performances [here](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZ4XUd6muK3D88PD2EvB8ow).

Skill sets:

- Audio signal processing, digital signal processing. (Matlab, Python, Librosa, Essentia, ffmpeg)
- Machine learning, deep learning, generative AI, latent space manipulation. (Pytorch, Tensorflow, Keras, Linux, AWS)
- Creative audio programming (MAX MSP, C++, Chuck, FAUST)
- Sound design for film and games (Ableton, Pro Tools, Wwise, FMOD, Unity)
- Web development and visual programming (Javascript, HTML, P5JS, Processing)
