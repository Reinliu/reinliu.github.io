I'm currently research intern at [Dolby Laboratories](https://www.dolby.com/) in Beijing working on text-to-spatial-audio generation with multi-modal large language models (MMLLMs). I recently submitted my Phd thesis at [University of Sydney](https://www.sydney.edu.au/engineering/about/our-people/research-students/rein-liu-210.html) in Electrical and Information Engineering. My Phd thesis is ‘Towards controllable neural audio synthesis: An exploration of sound effects creation with generative models’. My research focus is creating controllable and interactive sound generation tools that empowers creativity. To this end, I proposed several methods by taking advantage of pre-trained large audio representation models (CLAP, PANNs, VGGish, etc) to distill information from limited audio datasets and used such information to guide and control the audio synthesis. I typically work with generative models (Diffusion, Transformer, RAVE, StyleGAN) and differentiable digital signal processing (DDSP).

I come from a highly diverse background. Prior to my Phd, I received my B.A. Music and Sound Design at University of Technology Sydney and M.A. Interaction Design and Electronic Arts at University of Sydney. You can access my [portfolio](https://vimeo.com/reinliu) prior to 2021, when I was a media artist and sound designer. In 2023, I was a research intern at [Dolby Laboratories](https://www.dolby.com/) Advanced Technology Group(ATG) working on DDSP for general audio synthesis and control.

Apart from work, I play and teach the first electronic instrument called the Theremin. You can find my performances [here](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZ4XUd6muK3D88PD2EvB8ow).
